airline analytics project!

this project uses python to generate a mock dataset of airline data , stores it in a sql data base, 
and finally uses python to export csv files to analyze in power bi.

this project demonstrates a data analytics workflow focused on airline operational performance.
using mock flight and crew data inspired by real airline operations, i analyzed on-time performance,
delay trends, route efficiency, and potential operational drivers.

the goal of this project was to showcase skills in python, sql, and power bi while applying 
analytical tihinking to airline specific business problems.


tech i used: python (pandas, numpy), SQL(Sqlite), power bi, vs code, github

flow: -generated mock airline flight and crew datasets using python
	-loaded data into sqlite database
	-performed sql-based analysis and aggregations
	-conducted further analysis using pandas
	-built an interactive power bi dashboard for visualization
